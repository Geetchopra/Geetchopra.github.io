	<h1>GRAPHIC DESIGN PORTFOLIO</h1>
	<p>My first real design project in Photoshop was in Grade 12 where I contributed to our high school batch's hoodie design. Since then, I have been using the Adobe Creative Suite to design promotional material for numerous occasions. All of my knowledge is self taught, and I am constantly learning more and more. I now have a strong grasp over all the major Adobe applications. Scroll down to see some of my work that I have done over the past few years. Hover (Non-touch devices only) over each picture to learn more about it. You can also visit my <a href="https://www.behance.net/geetchopra">Behance</a> page to see more of my projects in the recent years.</p>
