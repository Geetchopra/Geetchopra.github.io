	<p>
		Over the years at the University of Toronto, I have completed a lot of courses spanning different areas of Computer Science, along with some covering topics of Game Design and Development. Most courses involved completing projects using proper development practices and helped me to learn more and develop my skills in those respective topics in Computer Science.
	</p>
	<p> 
		You can find below a list of all those courses and projects I have done that are relevant to the job titles I am looking to work as. Unfortunately, in the interest of protection from plagiarism by current students, I am not able to publicly include samples of code completed for the projects as instructed by professors. However, they can be promptly provided if requested!
