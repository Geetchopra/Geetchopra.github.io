		This is the latest game design project I have started working on, while I look for a full time job. I intend to release it on <span id="yellow">iOS / Steam</span> in the near future when this game finishes development.
	</p>
	<p>
		21 Days is an <span id="yellow">escape the maze</span> type of puzzle game which includes a horror theme to it. You are trapped in a never ending house (maze), and you have 21 Days to find your way out of it. There are <span id="yellow">extraterrestrial beings</span> wandering around in the house and you have to sneak around them in order to escape the house. There are also some <span id="yellow">items</span> that may help you deal with these beings by stunning them or damaging them etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		What makes this game unique is that, in this game, <span id="yellow">time is money</span>. Literally! Every action in this game, including walking, costs time and the more actions you take, the lesser amount of time you have to escape the maze. In other words, you really have 21 days to escape the house!
	</p>
	<p>
		This game is currently in its <span id="yellow">early development</span> phase, and includes a level blockmesh for the first / tutorial level of the game, which is also what I am currently working on. You can expect to see the complete level and a UI design in this game very soon!
	</p>
	<p>
