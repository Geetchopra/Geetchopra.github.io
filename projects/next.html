		The Ubisoft <a href="https://toronto.ubisoft.com/next/">NEXT</a> Showcase is an annual showcase organized by Ubisoft Toronto where students can prove their talents in game development to industry professionals. There are a lot of different disciplines available, including Programming, Animation and Level Design. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This year, I participated for the first time in this competition in the Level Design discipline. This discipline is split into two parts, a submission of a mission design document, which is open to everyone, and, if you progress to the next stage, a submission of a playable blockmesh of the same level.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can view the <span id="highlight">Mission Design Document</span> for the same <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Mgxcvs8kMfZicbuEsKLDCYjd8bN0n3s4">here</a>. I was also one of only 10 students to be selected for the submission of a <span id="highlight">Playable Blockmesh</span> of the above mission design document. To play that level, you can download it from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gsaTk7W06ZgiunV-62KyqDJ943cn-peS?usp=sharing">here</a>. Just open Game.exe and you're good to go! 
	</p>
	<p>
		This project made me explore Level Design in depth and I learned a lot about what goes into level design and some challenges that a typical level designer may encounter and ways with which I could solve those challenges.
