		Chestnotes is the A Capella choir, based at the Chestnut Residence at the University of Toronto. It was founded in 2015, when I was in my first year of college, and I have been a part of it ever since. I have also been responsible for all graphic design needs of the choir since the beginning. Since 2017, I have also taken up leadership roles as I gained seniority in the choir.
	</p>
	<p>
		The marketing portfolio for Chestnotes below was designed entirely by me, with additional feedback from the choir director. Since there isn't any official branding for the choir, I experiment a lot with different design styles for promoting our events each year, which explains the significant difference in the poster designs each year. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All headings include a poster advertisement for our bi-annual concert and a program brochure, handed out during the event that highlights the songs performed by us.
