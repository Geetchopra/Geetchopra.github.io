	TERMS OF SERVICE
</div>

<p class="policy-text">
	By downloading or using the app Tales of Harmonia, you are automatically agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the game. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.
</p>

<p class="policy-text">
	You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or its trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you should not try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Geet Chopra.

<div class="policy-sub-header">
	Limitations
</div>
<p class="policy-text">
	I am committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p>
<p class="policy-text">
	Certain functions of the app may require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. I also accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionality of the game.
</p>
